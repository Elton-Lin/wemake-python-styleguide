This file contains test cases that we want to add to the unit test
(might wanna consider edge cases where comment is the first or last thing in the file)

- Passing

1. simple

# Hello
#
# Hi

2. any number of empty comments surrounded by non-empty ones

# Hello
#
#
# Hi

3.


- Failing

1. simple case

#           <--- alert
my_var = 1

2. any number of empty comments

#           <--- alert
#
my_var = 5
#           <--- alert
#

3. similar to 2, but comment instead of code statement

#           <--- alert
#
# A cat
#           <--- alert
#
